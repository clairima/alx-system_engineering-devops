Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:

Start Time: 2023-11-01 14:00 (UTC)
End Time: 2023-11-01 16:30 (UTC)
Impact:

The service affected: User Authentication Service
User experience: Users were unable to log in during the outage.
Percentage of users affected: Approximately 30% of users were unable to access their accounts.
Root Cause:

The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an increased response time and eventual service degradation.
Timeline:

Issue Detection:

Detected at 2023-11-01 14:00 (UTC)
Detection method: Monitoring alert triggered due to a spike in authentication service response times.
Actions Taken:

Investigated load balancer logs and identified misconfiguration.
Assumed root cause: Initially suspected a database issue due to the nature of user authentication failures.
Misleading Paths:

Investigated database servers for potential issues, which proved to be a misleading path.
Escalation:

Incident escalated to the DevOps and Network Engineering teams.
Resolution:

Load balancer misconfiguration corrected at 2023-11-01 16:30 (UTC), restoring normal service.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:

Detailed explanation: The load balancer was misconfigured, causing uneven distribution of traffic and increased response times. This led to service degradation for a subset of users.
Resolution:

Detailed explanation: Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic, and additional monitoring was implemented to catch similar issues early.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

Improved monitoring alerts for load balancer performance.
Implemented regular load balancer configuration reviews.
Tasks to Address:

TODO: Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations quarterly.
TODO: Enhance documentation for load balancer configurations to prevent future misconfigurations.
Conclusion:

The recent web stack outage was attributed to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, impacting user authentication services. Swift detection through monitoring and collaborative efforts from the DevOps and Network Engineering teams led to a resolution within 2.5 hours. To prevent future occurrences, we have implemented improved monitoring and scheduled regular configuration reviews. This incident highlights the importance of proactive system monitoring and continuous refinement of our infrastructure to ensure a more robust and resilient user experience.
